# t-deck-ulisp
Attempt at getting ulisp running on the [Lilygo T-Deck](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-Deck) 

# notes
The [T-Deck repo](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-Deck)  contains instructions for how to upload code with the arduino IDE  

I used the [Arduino gfx](https://github.com/moononournation/Arduino_GFX) library instead of the adafruit one because the T-Deck repo examples had it working.
